# k-means

- clustering data

Step: 1

k = number of clusters we want to a have

Step: 2

randomly select k points as initial clusters

calculate the distance between each data point and cluster

assign the closest cluster to data point

Step 3

calculate the mean of each cluster

measure distance between data points again and cluster

best k-means if the variance is approximately equal for each cluster
